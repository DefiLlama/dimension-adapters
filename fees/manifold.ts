        When a new NFT is minted, a fee gets paid, the fee changes based on whether the NFT was minted with no whitelist or with a merkle whitelist
        However there's no event emitted that can be used to differentiate those two cases, so its impossible to track exact fees via events, only upper and lower bounds
        Because of that, the best way to track fees would be to track the difference in ETH balance for the contract and then subtract any withdrawal from the team
        But withdrawals don't emit any event
        So, given that withdrawals are very rare, what we do is just track the balance difference and when there's a withdrawal we fetch from traces
