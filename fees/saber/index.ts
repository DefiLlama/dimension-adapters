 * Swap Fees: Half the swap fees go to liquidity providers, adding another way to increase liquidity.
 * 
 * Fee Handling in Swap Operations:
 *
 * During a swap operation, the SwapData structure specifies the amount_in and the minimum_amount_out. 
 * The program calculates the output amount based on the current pool state and the swap curve. 
 * A portion of the input amount is allocated as a fee, which is distributed according to the pool's fee configuration. 
 * The net amount received by the user is the calculated output minus the fee. 
 * This ensures that fees are deducted directly from the transacted amounts, affecting the final amounts received or sent by users.
