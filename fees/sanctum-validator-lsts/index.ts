/*

Sanctum validator LSTs are LSTs deployed under the Sanctum stake pool programs (SP12tWFxD9oJsVWNavTTBZvMbA6gkAmxtVgxdqvyvhY or SPMBzsVUuoHA4Jm6KunbsotaahvVikZs1JyTW6iJvbn)
Total fees are the staking rewards (MEV + inflation) paid to all stake accounts from all Sanctum stake pools, paid to LST holders
Total revenue is withdrawal fees (0.1%) + epoch fees (2.5% of staking rewards) that are paid to each Sanctum LST's manager fee account, which are ATAs of EeQmNqm1RcQnee8LTyx6ccVG9FnR8TezQuw2JXq2LC1T (Sanctum wallet)

Before the fee switch mid-March 2025, Sanctum stake pools were charging 0.1% deposit fees
