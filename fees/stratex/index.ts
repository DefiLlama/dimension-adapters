/**
 * Stratex Protocol - DeFiLlama Dimension Adapter (Fees & Revenue)
 *
 * This adapter tracks fees and revenue for the Stratex Protocol on Base network.
 * It monitors entrance and exit fees collected from vault deposits and withdrawals.
 *
 * Metrics tracked:
 * - dailyFees: Total fees collected in the period
 * - dailyRevenue: Protocol revenue (100% of fees go to protocol treasury)
 * - dailyProtocolRevenue: Same as dailyRevenue (all revenue is protocol-controlled)
 * - dailyUserFees: Fees paid by users (same as dailyFees)
