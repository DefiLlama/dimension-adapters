/**
 * 
 * There are two main actors in rocketpool system: stakers and node operators
 * 
 * Stakers stake any amount of ETH into rETH - these ETH will be borrowed and staking into the Beacon chain by node operators
 * Node operators open minipools by stake atleast 8 or 16 ETH and must borrow 24 or 16 ETH from rETH and operate a validator on the Beacon chain
 * 
 * When node operators earn ETH rewards from Beacon chain, they earn 5%-14% commission
 * And node operators distribute remaining ETH rewards amount to rETH stakers
 * 
 * Here is an example scenario:
 * 
 * Node A open open a minipool of 8 ETH and with a commission of 5%, it need to borrow 24 ETH from rETH
 * Node A then stakes all 32 ETH and become a active validator on the Beacon chain
 * Node A earns 0.5 ETH rewards from Beacon chain and will distribute as follow:
 * - Total 5% of 0.5 ETH (0.025) earned by Node A as commission
 * - Node A also earned 25% if remaining 0.475 ETH from initial 8 ETH staking in minipool
 * - Node A distributes all remaing of 75% of 0.475 ETH to rETh stakers
 * 
 * As descrive above, total fees on Rocketpool are distributed to supply side stakers and minipools operators.
 * The Rocket Pool protocol matches liquid stakers with node operators. It does not take a fee for providing this service.
