/**
 * Across Adapter
 * 
 * NOTE: This implementation uses Dune queries rather than event-based calculations.
 * 
 * Previous event-based methods had bugs because:
 * 1. Events don't provide enough data points to accurately estimate fees
 * 2. Simple inputAmount-outputAmount calculations are incorrect as token amounts 
 *    have different decimal precision across chains
 * 3. Cross-chain token swaps (e.g., ETH from Arbitrum to USDC on Base) 
 *    complicates fee calculations
 * 
 * This Dune-based approach provides more accurate fee calculations by directly 
 * querying processed cross-chain transfer data.
