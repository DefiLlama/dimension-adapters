  - dailyFees: fee accured to the jito DAO (Withdrawal Fees, Interceptor Fees, Tip Router Fees).
  - dailyRevenue/dailyProtocolRevenue: Represents fees accruing specifically to the Jito DAO Treasury.
    This includes:
      - Withdrawal Fees (0.1% on unstake) from the JitoSOL stake pool.
      - Interceptor Fees (a portion of MEV rewards directed to the DAO).
      - Tip Router Fees (MEV tips explicitly routed to the DAO).
    This is calculated via the SQL query which sums transfers to specific DAO fee accounts.
  Note: Staking rewards distributed to JitoSOL holders are not included in these metrics.
