/// Voodoo Trade is the ultimate ETH-focused perpetual DEX on Base.
/// Voodoo caters solely to ETH/stable pairs, offering the deepest liquidity and most competitive
/// margin fees available, on par with CEX rates. LPs can earn real yield from both margin trades
/// and swaps on Base's most highly traded pair, with no need to hold any tokens besides ETH
/// and stables. Voodoo is a fair launch platform with support from an array of Base Ecosystem
/// stakeholders, and implements a long-term oriented tokenomics system that is the first of its
/// kind for perpetual DEXs.
