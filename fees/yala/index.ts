// Note: 
// Currently, the main logic of our platform is still based on the Ethereum platform.
//
// On the Bitcoin side, it's just a cross-chain transfer process. The transaction fee is the fee for the transfer. 
// It has nothing to do with the platform, so it was not included.
//
// On the Solana side, for the time being, we also use LayerZero for cross-chain transfer of the stablecoin Yu. 
// Then, we participate in yield on some cooperating platforms. The transaction fees are not related to the platforms. 
// We are also developing native applications for Solana. Once they are launched, we will include these fees.
