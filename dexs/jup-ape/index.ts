/**
 * Adapter for Ape.pro DEX on Solana
 * Volume data methodology:
 * 1. First identifies all transactions from Ape.pro by filtering solana.instruction_calls 
 *    where executing_account matches Ape.pro's program ID and instruction data matches swap signature(preFlashSwapApprove)
 * 2. Uses these transaction IDs to fetch corresponding trades from dex_solana.trades table
 *    which provides accurate USD amounts for each trade
 * 3. This approach is used instead of parsing instruction logs directly since they only contain
 *    inputAmount without quote amounts, which would require additional token price lookups
